# Biostats Tutorials – MMG3002Y

This repository contains selected tutorials from MMG3002Y (Biological Statistics) at the University of Toronto. The focus is on applying statistical tests and evaluating linear models using R.

## 📁 Included Files

- `tutorial09_wilcoxon_chi_square.Rmd`: Wilcoxon and Chi-square tests with genomics-inspired data framing
- `tutorial12_lm_diagnostics.Rmd`: Linear modeling with diagnostic plots using the cars dataset
- `figures/tutorial09_boxplot.png`: Boxplot comparing group expression distributions with an outlier
- `figures/tutorial12_residuals_plot.png`: Residuals vs fitted values plot from linear regression

## 🧰 Tools Used

- R, RMarkdown
- Base R graphics + ggplot2
- t-tests, Wilcoxon tests, Chi-square tests, linear regression

## 🎯 Learning Reflections

These tutorials helped reinforce key statistical concepts:
- Wilcoxon’s robustness to outliers
- Chi-square goodness-of-fit applications in genetic ratios
- Importance of residual diagnostics in real-world modeling

## 🔒 Note

All code and reflections are original and created for course-based learning and portfolio use.
